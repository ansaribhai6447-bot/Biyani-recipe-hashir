    <p>Biryani is not just food, it is a celebration in a pot. It is a perfect mix of fluffy rice, tender meat, and aromatic spices that create a dish loved by millions. The word “Biryani” is said to come from the Persian language, connected to rice and the method of cooking. Over centuries, Biryani spread through royal kitchens, becoming a part of festivals and family gatherings. Different regions added their own touch, giving us famous styles like the spicy Hyderabadi Biryani, the mild and fragrant Lucknowi Biryani, the Calcutta Biryani with potatoes, and the coastal Malabar Biryani. In this recipe, we will learn the traditional Chicken Biryani cooked in the “Dum” style, which is one of the most authentic methods. </p>

        <p>"Dum" means slow cooking on steam. In this style, the pot is sealed, and the food cooks in its own flavors. The rice, meat, onions, and spices come together slowly, making the taste rich and unforgettable. This technique is the secret behind the irresistible fragrance and perfect balance of flavors in every spoonful of Biryani. </p>
        <p>Think of this recipe as more than cooking—it is an experience. Each step has a purpose, from marinating the chicken to layering the rice and sealing the pot. With patience and care, you will create a dish that not only fills the stomach but also touches the heart. Once ready, your Biryani will be the highlight of any table, making everyone fall in love with its royal taste.</p>
